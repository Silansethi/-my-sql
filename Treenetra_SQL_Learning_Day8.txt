SET OPERATORS
--------------
Set operators are used to retrieve data from single (or) multiple tables. 
These operators are also called as “Vertical Joins”.
	Union -> It returns unique values and also automatically sorting data.
	Union all -> It returns unique + duplicate data. (no automatic sorting)
	Intersect -> It returns common values
	Minus -> Values are in first query those values are not in second query.
	
	
Eg:
SQL> select job from emp where deptno=10
union
select job from emp where deptno=20;

NOTE: Whenever we are using set operators, corresponding expressions must belongs to same data type.

Eg:
SQL> select deptno from emp
union
select dname from dept;
Error: expression must have same data type as corresponding expression

Eg:
SQL> select job from emp where deptno=10
union all
select job from emp where deptno=20;

Q-----What is difference between union and union all? 

UNION performs a DISTINCT on the result set, eliminating any duplicate rows.
UNION ALL does not remove duplicates, and it therefore faster than UNION.
If you know that all the records returned are unique from your union, 
use UNION ALL instead, it gives faster results.

A UNION places a result set on top another, meaning that it appends result sets vertically. 
However, a join such as INNER JOIN or LEFT JOIN combines result sets horizontally.

UNION removes duplicate and also does sorting operation while union all doesnot.

select 1 from dual 
union all
select '1' from dual
will throw error because the datatype should match here.	

Intersect -> It returns common values
select * from tableA
intersect
select * from tableB


Minus -> Values are in first query those values are not in second query.
select * from tableA
minus
select * from tableB;
