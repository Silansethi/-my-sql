Group Functions or Aggregiate Functions
----------------------------------------------------

Database having following group function
	max()
	min()
	avg()
	sum()
	count(*)
	count(column name)

1. Max(): It returns maximum value within a column.
Eg: SQL> select max(sal) from emp;

SQL> select max(hiredate) from emp;

SQL> select max(ename) from emp;

2. Min(): 
Eg: SQL> select min(sal) from emp;
750
To know the senior most employee
SQL> select min(hiredate) from emp;
17-DEC-80

In all database systems we are not allowed to use group functions in “where” clause. 
SQL> select * from emp where sal= min(sal);
Error: group function is not allowed in “where”

3. Avg(): It returns average from number data type column.
Eg: SQL> select avg(sal) from emp;
2473.21429
SQL> select avg(comm) from emp;
550
NOTE: In all database systems by default all group function ignores null values except “count(*)”.

To count all null values also:
SQL> select avg(nvl(comm,0)) from emp;
157.142857

4. Sum(): It returns total from number data type column.
Eg: SQL> select sum(sal) from emp;
34625

5. Count(*): It counts number of rows in a table(including null values) 
Eg: SQL> select count(*) from emp;

6. Count(column name): It counts the number of not null values within a column. 
SQL> select count(comm) from emp;
SQL> select count(distinct(dept no)) from emp;

Note: count(column) is better performance than count(*)

GROUP BY: 
--------
This clause is used to divide similar data items into set of logical groups.

select deptno,count(*) from emp group by deptno;
select job, count(*) from emp group by job;

Note: In all database systems we can also use “group by” clauses without using “group” functions.
Eg: SQL> select deptno from emp group by deptno;


In all databse systems after “group by” clause we are not allowed to use “where” clause.
Generally if we want to restrict groups after “group by” then we must use “having” clause. 
Generally in “where” clause we are not allowed to use group functions where as in having clause we can also use group functions. 

SQL> select deptno,count(*) from emp group by deptno where count(*)>3;
Error: SQL commond not properly ended.
Solution: SQL> select deptno, coutn(*) from emp group by deptno having count(*)>3;


--WHERE is used to filter records before any groupings take place.
--HAVING is used to filter values after they have  been groups.  


Note: In all database systems we are not allowed to use group functions in where clause but 
we are allowed to use number functions, character functions, date functions in where clause. 

Eg: select * from emp where sal=max(sal);
Error: group function is not allowed here.

but Q) write a query to display the employee whose employees length is 5 from emp table. 
Ans: SQL> select * from emp where length(ename)=5; ----->Allowed here.

Order	Clause	    Function
1	    FROM	    Tables are joined to get the base data.
2	    WHERE	    The base data is filtered.
3	    GROUP BY	The filtered base data is grouped.
4	    HAVING	    The grouped base data is filtered.
5	    SELECT	    The final data is returned.
6	    ORDER BY	The final data is sorted.
