ROWID:
------
Rowid is an pseudo column, it behaves like a table column whenever we are inserting data into table then 
datrabase automatically generates an unique identification number for identifying a record uniquely. This is called “ROWID”. 
Generally, using rowids we can retrieve data very quickly from database.

ROWID is a 16-digit Hexadecimal number in the format BBBBBBBB.RRRR.FFFF. Here B is Block, R is Row, and F is File.

--Generally, rownum having temporary values where as rowid having fixed values. 

--In database, by default rowids are ascending order.

Write a query to display second record from emp table using analytical function, rowid? 
Ans: select * from(select deptno, ename, sal, row_number() over(order by rowid)r from emp) where r=2;

Write a query to display each department second row from emp table using analytical function, rowid?
Ans: SQL> select * from(select deptno, ename, sal, row_number() over (partition by deptno order by rowid) r from emp where r=2);

Write a query to display last two records from emp table using analytical function, rowid?
Ans: SQL> select * from(select deptno, ename, sal, row_number() over (order by rowid desc) r from emp)where r<=2;

--We can also use max(), min() functions in “rowid's”.

Eg: SQL> select max(rowid) from emp;
SQL> select max(rowid) from emp;

Q) Write a query to display first row from emp table using rowid?
Ans: SQL> select * from emp where rowid=(select min(rowid) from emp);

Q) Write a query to display last record from emp table using rowid?
Ans: SQL> select * from emp where rowid=(select max(rowid) from emp);

--Generally, rowids are used in subquerys for deleting duplicate rows in a table. 

Write a query to delete duplicate rows except one row in each group from a table using rowid?
Ans: delete from test where rowid not in(select min(rowid) from test group by sno); 

ROWNUM (Magic Column)?
----------------------
Rownum is an Psuedo column(generalised column) it behaves like a table column. 
Whenever we are installing oracle server then automatically some psuedo columns are created in database. 
These “Pseudo Columns” belongs to all tables within database. Rownum psuedo column is used to filter the data within a table.
Rownum is a psuedo column which automatically assigns numbers to each row in a table at the time of selection.
Oracle ROWNUM is a pseudocolumn that assigns a number to each row returned by a query. 
It’s assigned before an ORDER BY is performed, so you shouldn’t order by the ROWNUM value.

But it will work if you enclose the order by in subquery. 
For Ex:
SELECT ROWNUM, first_name, last_name, address_state
FROM (
  SELECT first_name, last_name, address_state
  FROM student
  ORDER BY last_name
) sub
WHERE ROWNUM <= 5;


SQL> select rownum, ename from emp;

ROWNUM	ENAME
-------------
1	    SMITH
2	    ALLEN
3	    WARD
Generally, rownum having temporarily values.

Write a query to display first row from emp table using rownum? 
Ans: SQL> select * from emp where rownum=1;

Write a query to display second row from emp table using rownum? 
Ans: SQL> select * from emp where rownum=2;
No rows selected

Generally, rownum doesn't work with more than “1” +ve integer, i.e it works with <, <= operators.

Write a query to display first five rows from emp table using rownum? 
Ans: SQL> select * from emp where rownum<=5;

Write a query to display first five highest salary of employees from emp using rownum? 
Ans: SQL> select * from( select * from emp order by sal desc) where rownum<=5;

Write a query to display 5th highest salary employee from emp table using rownum? 
Ans: SQL> select * from(select * from emp order by sal desc) where rownum <= 5 
minus
select * from(select * from emp order by sal desc) where rownum<=4;

Write a query to display rows between 1 to 5 from emp table using “Rownum”?
Ans: SQL> select * from emp where rownum between 1 and 5;

Write a query to display rows between to 5 to 10 from table? 
Ans: SQL> select * from emp where rownum between 5 and 10; No rows selected

Solution: SQL> select * from emp where rownum <=10 minus
select * from emp where rownum<=5;

SQL> select * from emp where rownum>1; 
No rows selected

SQL> select * from emp where rownum>=1; 
No Rows selected

NOTE: Whenever we are using alias name for rownum in “INLINE VIEWS” then that alias name works with all SQL operators because 
that alias name behaves like a table column.

Write a query to display second record from emp table using “rownum” alias name?
Ans: SQL> select * from(select rownum r, ename, job, sal from emp) where r=2;

If we want to display all the columns from the table using rownum.
SQL> select * from( select rownum r, emp.* from emp) where r=2;
OR
SQL> select * from(select rownum r, e.* from emp e) where r=2;

Write a query to display second, third, fifth, seventh, eighth rows from emp table using rownum alias name?
Ans: SQL> select * from (select rownum r, e.* from emp e) where r in(2,3,5,7,8);

Write a query to display records from 5 to 9 from emp table using rownum alias name? 
Ans: SQL> select * from(select rownum r, emp.* from emp) where r between 5 and 9;

Write a query to display first and last records from emp table using rownum alias name?
Ans: SQL> select * from(select rownum r, emp.* from emp) where r=1 or r=(select count(*) from emp);

Write a query to display even number of records from emp table using rownum alias name?
Ans: SQL> select * from(select rownum r, emp.* from emp) where r in(select mod(r,2)=0 from emp);
Solution: SQL> select * from(select rownum r, emp.* from emp) where mod(r,2)=0;

Write a query to display skip first 5 rows from emp table using rownum alias name? 
Ans: SQL> select * from (select rownum r, emp.* from emp) where r>5;

16-----what is Difference B/w Rowid And Rownum?

ROWNUM is temporary while ROWID is permanent unique identifier for a row.

Q-----Difference between Rownum and Row_Number()

ROWNUM is a pseudocolumn and has no parameters. ROW_NUMBER is an analytical function which takes parameters.
ROWNUM is calculated on all results but before the ORDER BY. ROW_NUMBER is calculated as part of the column calculation.
ROWNUM is unique. ROW_NUMBER can contain duplicates.
